## REGO Language

### What is Rego?
Rego was inspired by Datalog, which is a well understood, decades old query language. Rego extends Datalog to support structured document models such as JSON.

Datalog is a declarative logic programming language
Rego is declarative so policy authors can focus on what queries should return rather than how queries should be executed. These queries are simpler and more concise than the equivalent in an imperative language.

- Deploying OPA alongside your service
- Pushing relevant data about your service's state into OPA's document store
- Offloading some or all decision-making to OPA by querying it
